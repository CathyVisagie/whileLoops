Follow these steps:
● Note: For this task you will need to create an HTML file to get input from a
user. If you need a refresher on how to do this, go back to the example.js
and index.html files in your Task 1 folder for examples.
● Create a new file called while.js.
● Write a program that always asks the user to enter a number.
● When the user enters -1, the program should stop requesting the user to
enter a number.
● The program must then calculate the average of the numbers entered,
excluding the -1.
● Make use of the while loop repetition structure to implement the
program.
● Compile, save, and run your file.
